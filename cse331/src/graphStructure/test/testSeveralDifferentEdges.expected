#test several different edge combinations

#create graph
created graph graph1

#add nodes
added node me to graph1
added node parent to graph1
added node friend to graph1

#add edges
added edge p2m from parent to me in graph1
added edge m2f from me to friend in graph1
added edge f2m from friend to me in graph1

#print children/ edges and nodes in graph
graph1 contains: friend me parent
the children of parent in graph1 are: me(p2m)
the children of me in graph1 are: friend(m2f)
the children of friend in graph1 are: me(f2m)
